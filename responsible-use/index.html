    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
     The purpose of this document is to raise awareness of the ethical responsibilities of both makers and users of geographical information on the web, and to get the conversation started in relevant audiences. While there is considerable discussion of data ethics in general, this document illustrates the issues specifically associated with the nature of geographical information and both the benefits and risks of sharing this information implicitly and explicitly on the web.

    </p>

<section id='context'>
    <h2>Context</h2>

<p>
Geospatial data is like a finger print: every combination of space, time and travel is unique. The interaction with geospatial data can therefore lead to brilliant insights and services. Nevertheless, because spatial is special it ought to be handled with care. But what is careful and what is careless? Let’s discuss.

<p>
Even though W3C is famous for developing standards, this note is not normative. Rather than presenting an overview of best practices ready for implementation, the purpose of this note is to start the conversation. You are therefore encouraged to join the authors of this document in exploring the question: “How do we use geospatial data responsibly?”

<p>
The note is a living document, ready to be enriched with ethical wisdom from across the world. Current ideas presented in the note are framed by a western perspective, so further international collaboration is much appreciated.

<p>
Too often data ethics is presented as the solution to avoid unacceptable consequences of data misuse. This note will aim to demonstrate that this conversation is not only necessary out of fear of misuse, but more importantly to unlock geospatial data’s full potential. To make the world a better place.

<section id='data-ethics'>
        <h2>Data Ethics</h2>
<p>
The interest and concerns around data ethics have grown over the past few years. Universities offer data ethics courses; companies and organisations design and conduct data ethics codes; government institutions implement data ethics governance. But what does data ethics mean? A simple search provides a myriad of data ethics frameworks, -codes and -guidelines. They all have the same purpose: to safeguard a responsible use of data.
<p>
Not all data are the same: there are varying degrees of sensitivity. In most jurisdictions, the law accounts for the protection of sensitive data, particularly personal data. But can we rely on privacy laws to ensure responsible use of data? Perhaps more importantly, does the law determine what is considered responsible?
<p>
Earlier this year, when the world was engulfed by the first wave of COVID-19, governments across the world turned to data specialists for help. Seeing as COVID-19 is highly contagious, scientists have advised policies that ensure (social) isolation of COVID-19 patients. As a measure to control further transmission of the virus, many countries therefore prioritised the identification and location of these patients. The approach towards this policy varied. By April, China, Israel, Poland, Singapore, South Korea and Japan invited or legally obliged citizens to use track and trace COVID-19 apps. The apps give government institutions (indeterminate) access to the users’ personal location data and record users’ potential COVID-19 symptoms. The level of intrusion varies per app, but even the most “innocent” apps clearly hold sensitive information as personal location data is, by definition, sensitive.
<p>
Not only governments are relying on these ‘tracking’ apps. Private entities have been acquiring both real time- and non-real time location information for years. However, as the technology improves, the distance between its application and the societal impact grows. Location data has become a commodity. It is in high demand and profitable, but at which cost? And who pays the price? A commoditization of location data has the potential to benefit society, but that requires strong legal or communal pressure. Pressure to collect, process, visualise, use and remove the data in a responsible way. So, where should this pressure come from? Legislation? Companies relying on location data? Ethical officers employed by these companies?
<p>
Every role or function that interacts with location data has a responsibility to show ethical leadership. That is the only way to incorporate ethics by design into the entire project/process. Based on panel discussions, webinars and workshops about this topic, it is evident that the geospatial community is eager to show ethical leadership. The only question left is: How?

            <h3>The Link Between Ethics and Law</h3>
            <p>
                There is a virtual cycle between data ethics and law, brought about by globalization and the localized
                nature of laws. Where ethical concerns within a region accelerate faster than other areas, legislators
                create laws that provide protections deemed necessary by citizens. These laws often provide templates
                for other regions, potentially influencing prevailing regional ethical concerns. In the case of data
                privacy, GDPR has provided a template that many countries have adapted, resulting in a framework of
                rights that have found their way into legal frameworks for privacy. The following rights broadly capture
                these concerns. Three laws were referred to in order that commonality across regions could be confirmed.
                These were the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and
                Australian Privacy Act. Where a right is included in these laws, it is indicated under the corresponding
                right.

                The Right of Access gives individuals the right to obtain a copy of the personal information held about
                them. It also includes supplementary information such as the purpose of processing, categories of
                personal data processed, recipients or categories of recipients, the right to object and instructions on
                how, and the existence of automated decision taking based on the information held.

                The Right to Know gives people the right to be informed about the collection and use of an individual’s
                personal data, which extends to a number of additional obligations by the manager of that data.
                Additional obligations include identification of data managers and protection officers, processing
                purposes and interests pursued, intention to transfer and the intended recipients, duration of storage,
                and rights of the data subject including the ability to withdraw consent.

                The Right to be Forgotten is the right to request erasure of data. If the data has been made public, or
                passed onto to third parties, all reasonable measures must be taken to inform recipients that all copies
                of the data originating from their disclosure must be erased.

            <h3>Geolocation Specifically</h3>
            <p>
                CCPA goes further from a location perspective, including geolocation in the definition of personal
                information. This has given rise to a number of additional responsibilities for data managers. Privacy
                policies require updating to reflect any capture of geolocation. Users should be required to opt-in with
                just-in-time notice prior to collection of geolocation. CCPA requires this consent to be provided
                separately to any general End User License Agreement, privacy policy, conditions of use, or similar
                document. To comply with the Act, collection of geolocation can only commence after a data manager can
                prove that consent to collect (and transmit if applicable) was given, that consent was not later
                withheld or revoked, and that the captured geolocation precision is not greater than the precision for
                which consent was given.

        <h2>Existing Ethical Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
        Worldwide there is a large range of existing ethical frameworks related to data. Developed by national governments (like the UK Gov data ethics Framework and the USA GSA Data Ethics Framework); by governmental organisations (like the United Nations: Data Privacy, Ethics and Protection Guidance Note and the Eurocities principles on citizen data); by universities (like the Oxford-Munich Code of conduct for professional data scientists); by communities (like the Tech pledge); by companies (like the planet.com code of ethics); by NGO’s (like Unicef’s Ethical Considerations When Using Geospatial Technologies for Evidence Generation); and so on.
        <p>
        The purpose, audience and scope of each framework differ a lot. From very abstract to very specific, from general principles to detailed instructions, from a wide audience to a single target group.
        <p>
        It’s relevant to notice that at the highest level, the core values of these frameworks generally correspond. They all recognise the importance of transparency, privacy and security, accountability, inclusiveness and more. However, they also share the same blind spot: none of the frameworks* acknowledge that spatial data is special. Even though geospatial is both increasingly topical and necessary, considering the speed at which it is developing.
        <p>
        *A noteworthy exception to this are the Unicef ethical considerations. In order to protect children in unsafe regions, the use of spatial data is both essential and risky. Therefore a critical and detailed assessment of data is crucial.

</section>
<section id='spatial-is-special'>
    <h2>Spatial is Special</h2>
    <p>
        All domains are special. After all, this is what sets them apart from their neighboring disciplines. Space and
        time, however, are special in how they cut across domains. They are the glue that helps us organize knowledge
        about the world around us. We may be interested in events, such as landslides, that appeared within a region to
        mitigate future risks, or we may be interested in events that happen during the same time but in a different
        region, such as country-specific social distancing measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the first case,
        space remains invariant; in the second case, time is invariant while we are interested in spatial differences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spatial data is special in many regards. The regional variability in the examples above illustrates two
        competing properties of spatial phenomena. Spatial heterogeneity as a first-order property implies that it is
        challenging to find observations that are prototypical for a particular region, e.g., which county is most
        representative for COVID-19 transmission patterns. While spatial dependence as a second-order property between
        observations violates traditional statistical theory. Samples are not independent; they covary as a function of
        their distance. For instance, nearby sensors are likely to observe similar amounts of rainfall.
    </p>
    These two competing properties simultaneously drive the abilities and risks associated with spatial analytics, e.g.,
    with regards to human movement. We assume that people frequenting the same places (or place types) may have other
    similarities, such as common interests or demographic characteristics. However, great care has to be taken when
    trying to assign properties averaged over a region to individuals, a problem known as the ecological fallacy. This
    is particularly critical as modern information retrieval and recommender system utilize a person's location history
    as a predictive feature. Frequently visiting a health care facility is not only indicative of health issues but also
    of being a health care worker and those two cases may be difficult to distinguish.
    <p>
        Location information also increasingly triggers actions in the physical world around us , e.g., via geo-fencing,
        or determines which information we receive, creating local information bubbles known as hyperlocal media.
        Unfortunately, masking or perturbing location information comes with its own associated risks. For example, it
        may place a user into a geographic area associated with another person. Similarly, users that share their
        location, e.g., bike trajectory, may be mistaken for another person of the substantially larger population of
        people that do not share their location in real time such as in a recent case involving a racially motivated
        attack by a biker. Finally, the value of spatial and temporal information does not scale linearly with size,
        once a certain spatial and temporal resolution has been achieved it becomes possible to monitor people and infer
        their future behavior on a very fine grained level. This includes positive aspects such as finding missing
        people or preventing crime, but also highly problematic cases such as targeting individuals, e.g., for political
        or cultural reasons.

    <h2>Principles of Ethical Data Sharing - The Developer Perspective</h2>
    <p>
        In this section a framework is presented which identifies some approaches which application and online services
        developers may take to minimise the risk associated with the collection of Geospatial data collected as a result
        of the movements of individuals in time and space, Mobility Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Privacy preserving techniques should be used to minimise the risk of misuse or disclosure of information while
        at the same time obtaining the benefits associated with a knowledge of individuals locations to offer location
        based services and to provide crucial safety information during emergency situations.
    </p>
    <section id='efficacy'>
        <h2>Efficacy of Mobility Data</h2>
        <p>
            With the widespread adoption of smartphones and other devices which have direct or indirect abilities to be
            geolocated the interest in developing new applications and services which make use of this valuable
            information have rapidly increased. The Location Based Services market grew rapidly in the last decade but
            not all applications of mobility data were successful, in many cases the expected benefits were not
            achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example an early use case in mobile marketing conceived of a potential customer walking past a shop and
            automatically receiving notifications from the shop owner offering special offers and other incentives. The
            reason this did not happen is that such intrusive advertising would not work and would only annoy potential
            customers, such a use case would not produce the results desired, it is an issue of Efficacy – In simple
            terms would it even work ?
        </p>
        <p>
            Other issues may result from the difficult of using GNSS indoors or in dense Urban environments, the power
            consumption and impact of GNSS receivers on smartphone batteries preventing continuous tracking applications
            and during the COVID-19 pandemic the use of contact tracing applications where for numerous reasons many
            citizens refuse to instal voluntary government apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent these type of issues realistic operational testing and the development of extensive user testing
            should be undertaken to prove the efficacy of the application before the application is introduced and
            geospatial data captured as a result.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Extensive User testing required to prove underlying technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is context to efficacy of course, you might want to try a technique that is unproven if circumstances
            are severe, a global pandemic might be such an example? If so would it be acceptable to experiment first to
            gather data using a time limited application ?
        </p>
        <p>
            Linked to this would be the efficacy of an application over time, while it might be acceptable to collect
            information during an emergency, for example monitoring the location of the population during a hurricane
            evacuation, the location data would and should have no value when the storm has passed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This level of specificity of use is a general requirement of most data protection legislation, in that data
            should only be collected for a particular use – so you would be prevented from using the data later for any
            other purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Data collection for specific purposes limited in coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Related to the temporal aspect of such data collection of course is the spatial context, an application
            collecting information on the movements of a commuter in Paris should not collect data when the user is on
            holiday in London or even Nice. Likewise an app developed to monitor adherence to a quarantine requirement
            should only operate for the duration of the specific event.

        <h2>Equibility</h2>
        <p>
            It’s easy to imagine the development of an application that uses a devices location to validate financial
            transactions to minimise fraud, transactions will only be valid if the device is at the same location as the
            retail purchase.. Such applications have been developed although they have not been widely deployed because
            of questions of efficacy as noted above.
        </p>
        <p>
            But is it acceptable to expect everyone to have a smartphone with Ambient location technology to be able to
            make purchases ?
        </p>
        <p>
            Access to services should not rely on access to expensive sophisticated devices, an alternative needs to be
            available for those without or unwilling to use smartphones for example.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Solutions should be accessible to all members of society.
        </p>
        <p>
            Access to technology may also vary for other societal or cultural differences and this may not be easily
            understood or unexpected, it there is an urgent need to build solutions based on ambient location, there
            active measures at a governmental level made be needed for example subsidising the purchase of smartphones
            and or data plans for example or making available dedicated devices as in the case of Singapore’s
            TraceTogther tokens <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg">https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be the case that for some applications and systems restricting the use of location data collection my
            result in a reduced user experience for example the incognito mode in Google maps cannot access your past
            search history or preferred mode of transport preferences however such limitations should be explained and

        <h2>Design Choices</h2>
        <p>
            For many developers of applications or services that need to implement location data collection and sharing
            discussions around the ethical approach to take may appear rather esoteric or at least academic in nature.
            How one builds an app or service that uses ambient location in a responsible way is of course a question or
            engineering design choices
        </p>
        <p>
            Here a number of design principles are presented, that are hopefully clear and pragmatic. There will of
            course always be scope for compromises and seldom are choices clearly right or wrong, there must be the
            ability to use a nuanced approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            These design principles are by no means comprehensive but a useful starting point.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Location Data collection and or sharing should be voluntary.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be clear the collection and sharing of location data are different things. There are many use
            cases that might require a user's location to be obtained, but that data does not need to be stored on
            device or on a server after the location is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clearly a ride sharing application needs to be able to access your phones location to arrange the dispatch
            of the closest car, however the collection of your location data while you are walking about for analytical
            purposes is not necessary for the operation of the service and you should be able to opt out of this form of
            collection if you wish.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            There should be an explicit mechanism to obtain user consent to the collect and then share Ambient Location
            Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if the collection and sharing of location data is not optional there should be an explicit notification
            and ongoing reaffirmation of the users agreement. This is important particularly if location sharing is a
            background process with little or no user interface indication that it is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course the user should be able to change their mind and temporarily or permanently stop sharing at a time
            of their choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again reinforcing the first principle collection and sharing are separate activities and should require
            separate user consent.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            The purpose of data collection and/or sharing must be explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is already a key foundation of most good data protection regulations, you need to explain clearly why
            you are collecting location information and how it will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may share your location information (perhaps proximity) with the Apple Store, so that the Genius will
            know you have arrived for your appointment for example. Although it might be useful to know the other stores
            you have visited before Apple, if they don’t state they will use the data for that purpose, they must not
            use it ! And to be clear they don’t !
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Data Collection/Sharing should be limited in scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again a key data protection principle is to only collect the minimum amount of data required, there is no
            allowable concept of “nice to have in case we need it”.
        </p>
        <p>
            In geospatial terms there is a particular issue with resolution both in terms of time and space, there are
            very few applications outside of turn by turn navigation that require precise real time location data.
        </p>
        <p>
            For your hyperlocal weather forecasting app wifi or cell based positioning to within a hundred metres is
            easily good enough!
        </p>
        <p>
            Differential privacy provides a promising privacy preserving technique for location data. It is based on
            injecting random noise into location data so that both the level of privacy and usefulness of the data is
            quantified and controlled.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Data must be kept securely and by default anonymously.
        </p>
        <p>
            There needs to be a really, really good reason for Ambient Location information not to be anonymous. For
            most of the current popular applications where Ambient Location information is used to “sense” the world,
            anonymous data is all that is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might be that some considerable effort, as in differential privacy, must be applied to data to maintain
            privacy , but there is great risk associated with linking individuals to their location.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recent debate on different approaches to contact tracing, centralised vs. decentralised is illustrative
            here, in both cases the data collected is anonymous however there is greater risk in the centralised model
            that there could be a security compromise and data “could” be identifiable at least theoretically.
        </p>
        <p>
            The risk comes from storing the data in one location as opposed to distributed on individual devices.
            Against this risk of course there may be counter arguments that from a perspective of epidemiology it is
            valuable to be able to view the graph of user interactions only possible with a central repository of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of where Ambient Location data is stored it should be secure, encrypted both “At Rest” e.g. on
            the device or server but also “In transit” while moving across the network between device and server.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Location data may be Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?
        </p>
        <p>
            The data that can be considered to be personally identifiable extends beyond the obvious name, address and
            telephone number and there are grey areas specifically with types of Geospatial Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any data that, with the favourite legal term of “reasonable effort”, can be used to identify an individual
            data subject is Personally Identifiable Information. So the IP address of the client using your service is
            PII, as is any device ID specific to a mobile phone for example such as the IMEI or IMSI code.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are obvious, but geospatial imagery also brings unique challenges. While satellite imagery and aerial
            photography can be argued to be not PII as the resolution of imagery and the generally vertical orientation
            of imagery makes identifying individuals impossible, the same cannot be said for terrestrial imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it would be possible to combine an image taken at ground level where an individual could be
            recognised, with metadata of when the image was acquired it is necessary for services such as Google Maps
            “Street View” and Apples “Look Around” to blur faces and car registration plates.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Location data storage must be time & space limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is the collection of Ambient Location Information temporary and limited to a defined period of storage, and
            if not why not ? Again of course there may be applications where the user might want data to be stored
            indefinitely, for example I have been storing my Location History in Google Maps since 2011 and it’s nice to
            be able to look back at my travels. But this is my explicit choice, recently an option has been introduced
            to automatically delete your location history after a period time – of course after you have opted in to
            it’s collection in the first place!

        <h2>Privacy-preserving Approaches to Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
         An important emerging technique to ensure the privacy of individuals' location data is differential privacy.  Differential privacy helps developers of geospatial services to  derive insights from data while at the same time  ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or re-identified.
Differential privacy works by injecting noise into statistical or geospatial functions, reducing resolution of data in time and space while maintaining the information content.  Differential Privacy techniques crucially also offer testing mechanisms which allow the success of the techniques to be quantified and varied in effectives for particular use cases.

    <h2>Principles of Ethical Data Sharing - The User Perspective</h2>
    <p>
        The sustained popularity of smartphones has driven down the cost of electronic cameras and GNSS receivers to the
        point where virtually every mobile phone now has the capability to capture geotagged images, making it quick,
        easy and cheap for the general public to share their location data with the global online community.
    </p>
    <p>
        While most users understand the basic precautions required for safe financial transactions online and take
        appropriate steps to protect their personal payment details, many are oblivious to the potential dangers of
        broadcasting their geospatial information. Sharing photos of a garden barbeque, competing with friends on
        exercise leaderboards or posting a holiday snap on social media are perfectly safe activities provided the user
        has a clear understanding of the possible pitfalls and takes simple measures to mitigate the risks.

                Geospatial data can be legitimately used for many different activities and users should be aware of its
                nature and purpose to make informed decisions about whether or not their processed data can be safely
                shared online. However, it may be unclear what information could be revealed to other people by sharing
                location data or that geospatial details are being included at all.

                GNSS receivers can provide accurate geospatial information for outside locations, though the level of
                detail varies for different applications. For example, a fitness app has a valid need to process the
                accurate relative position to best calculate the user’s speed and distance, though their absolute
                location in the world is not relevant to measuring their physical performance, e.g. the name of the town
                in which they are exercising. Conversely, a weather app needs to know the user’s area location in order
                to provide an accurate forecast, but has no proper requirement for their precise location as the climate
                will not differ on opposite sides of the same street.

                Sharing personal geospatial data creates a unique signature for an individual which can reveal their
                presence at or absence from an identifiable location at a particular moment in time. For example,
                sharing photos of a family barbeque online may inadvertently reveal the location of the garden from the
                image’s geotag which could be used to identify their home address. Subsequently posting a holiday snap
                on a social media platform could indicate that the family is currently absent from home for a period of
                time, especially if the picture is from overseas, making the property a more attractive target for

                A single location has many associated properties which can reveal valuable information, so sharing
                geospatial coordinates carries the inherent risk that it can be difficult to foresee the unintended

            including the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
            How the guidance is applied will depend on the particular use case, but it is important to explain the aims

            <h3>Key Message Elements</h3>
            <p>
                The first message is to raise public awareness that location data is as important and sensitive as their
                financial details. The public are familiar with basic financial security measures and understand that
                though there are risks, online transactions can be performed easily and safely with a few simple
                precautions. The same is true for using location data responsibly, so people need to be aware of
                situations that may involve location details, e.g. sharing geotagged photos, understand the risks and
                take suitable precautions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important questions to answer when dealing with location data are:

            <ol>
                <li>What is included?</li>
                <li>How is it used?</li>

            <h3>Location Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Users should expect responsible developers and service providers who collect or use geospatial data to
                provide a clear written statement about location data use in their product which answers these three
                questions and a comprehensible privacy policy. Statements should include comprehensive justification for
                geospatial data use and practical steps that users can take to mitigate risks in order to keep
                themselves safe without sensationalising the dangers. Failure to provide such information should serve
                as a warning to the user that the product should not be trusted as the provider does not deem the safety
                of their users to be sufficiently important.

                consideration.

            <h3>User Interface</h3>
            <p>
                Developers also have a responsibility to highlight when geospatial data are being used. Most modern web
                browsers display safety-critical information next to the web address to confirm whether network access
                is encrypted or that the browser is accessing the user’s camera or microphone with easily recognised
                icons such as a padlock for encryption. Geospatial data should be similarly represented using a
                well-known icon such as the location pin so users are aware that their location is visible to others.
                For example, when a photo is taken using a smartphone, the user interface should clearly display whether
                or not geotag information is included.

    <h2>Principles of Ethical Data Sharing - The Regulator Perspective</h2>
    <section id='regulator-role'>
        <h2>The Role of the Regulator</h2>
        <p>
            As discussed in section 2.2, ethics and law guide each other. Particularly in times where public or personal
            safety are concerned, ethical lines can grey with regard to the sharing of location data, as was evidenced
            by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019. Here, the role of the regulator is to outline what controls may be
            necessary to ensure that individuals are protected from harm and breach of privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other grey examples include tweets during crises that can be used to actually detect the crisis. The US
            Geological Survey Tweet Earthquake Dispatch analysis social media, and uses geolocation combined with
            machine learning to detect earthquakes. This analysis is capable of detecting earthquakes faster than
            conventional scientific instruments which can take up to 20 minutes to perform the same task, albeit more
            accurately. However, the release of information that provides a location of activities conducted by a
            particular target group could be used maliciously. For example, geolocation of dating apps could be used by
            a predator to find common meetup spots where women will be isolated and may not be able to identify them as
            strangers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Location is often used as the means of achieving data integration. This too has its risks. Data which cannot
            otherwise be linked together can be using the location dimension, and in a way that helps a subject to be
            identified that might otherwise not be.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of regulators is to provide the guard rails that help provide confidence to users that their data
            will be protected, and to developers that they know their responsibilities as data managers.

        <h2>Examples of Good Practice</h2>
        <section id='integrating-authorities'>
            <h3>Integrating Authorities (Australia)</h3>
            <p>
                Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources to create a unified view. The resulting data
                presents new knowledge that can be applied toward achievement of social good, business objectives, and personal gain.
                There are countless examples of data integration being used for positive outcomes for society, including integration of
                health data to improve the quality of patient centred care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Australia has had the concept of Integrating Authorities for some time. These organisations undergo
                accreditation to ensure that the processes they follow to integrate Commonwealth data create accurate
                matches, whilst at the same time preserve the privacy of the subjects. The Commonwealth also developed <a
                href="https://toolkit.data.gov.au/files/High_Level_Principles_for_Data_Integration_Involving_Commonwealth_Data_for_Statistical_and_Research_Purposes.pdf">7
                High Level Principles for Data Integration</a>. These principles outline, among other things, Custodian and
                Integrator responsibilities to preserve privacy and confidentiality during integration exercises, along with the
                need to highlight impacts upon them originating from each exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst restricted to integration of Commonwealth of Australia data, the accreditation provides
                reasonable guidelines for good practice for integrating data.
