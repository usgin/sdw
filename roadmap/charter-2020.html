        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Spatial Data on the Web IG is scoped to realize the W3C side of the Joint W3C/OGC Organizing Committee (JWOC). The JWOC exists to facilitate direct cooperation between the spatial information and Web communities, allowing each to benefit from the other's data, technologies and methods. The JWOC will publish joint work where appropriate and may recommend the creation of formal standards-defining working groups where necessary in one or both standards development organizations.</p>
        <p>The Spatial Data on the Web IG will:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>coordinate between OGC and W3C on shared interests and raise awareness of their complementary strengths (e.g. Web scale architecture, accessibility, privacy, internationalisation, geospatial expertise) – monitor and liaise between groups from OGC and W3C.</li>
	  <li>identify areas where standards should be developed jointly by both W3C and OGC.</li>
	  <li>respond to requests from OGC Architecture Board (OAB) and W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) to review materials relating to Geospatial Web standards, and bring relevant matters to the attention of the OAB and TAG.</li>
    <li>periodically review the <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/ideas/issues">OGC Innovation Program</a> ideas issue tracker to identify and prioritise important ideas relating to the geospatial Web standards.</li>
    <li>periodically review the <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-Technology-Trends/blob/master/README.md">OGC Technology Trends.</a></li>
    <li>provide an open, public forum where early ideas for geospatial Web standards can be shared (e.g. as a GitHub issue) until they migrate into a Community Group, Domain Working Group or Testbed activity for further development.</li>
    <li>provide introductions between originators of ideas for geospatial Web standards and potential collaborators and stakeholders in OGC and W3C.</li>
    <li>seek out existing forums (e.g. W3C Community Group, OGC Domain Working Group, OGC Testbed / Innovation Programme) where ideas for geospatial Web standards can be developed to the point where they are mature enough to Charter a W3C Working Group and/or an OGC Standards Working Group; where no existing forums are a good fit, SDW-IG will support establishment of the most appropriate forum in OGC or W3C.</li>
    <li>maintain references to the working resources of designated groups
    where ideas for geospatial Web standards are being developed, and
    track progress of development using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/labels/Geospatial">W3C’s “strategy funnel”.</a>.</li>
    <li>provide support to develop SWG Charters and help determine whether the SWG should reside in OGC or W3C, or be a joint SWG.</li>
    <li>manage errata for Spatial Data on the Web Working Group documents enumerated in deliverables.</li>
    <li>support the creation of OGC profiles of W3C specifications, in cases where spatio-temporal aspects are worth standardising beyond W3C concerns, as the need for such profiles are established.</li>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a> and the <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/oab" title="OGC Architecture Board">OAB</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Technical discussions for this Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about
	  deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
	  meetings) will be available from the <a
	  href="https://www.w3.org/2017/sdwig">Spatial Data on the Web
	  Interest Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-sdwig" href="mailto:public-sdwig@w3.org">public-sdwig@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sdwig/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'> one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
